  <h2><i class="fa fa-code"></i> Technical brief</h2>
  <p>Engines is a managed system of containerised applications and services. It is controlled through a fully-featured web front end. Its purpose is to provide nontechnical users with tools to easily launch a machine (VM or BM) and install a collection of server software. Software can be easily configured for data access and sharing.</p>
  <p>Engines provides users with the benefits of self-hosting, such as data sovereingty, without the challenges normally associated with DIY servers.</p>
  <p>Engines can run a wide range of software while maintaining system and data security. Application images are built locally. This underpins security and makes it possibe to automatically integrate software with a local environment and system services.</p>
  <p>Software blueprints are used to define an installation and to configure the associated image build process. The installation process is generally fully-automaed. Some installation processes complete after receiving input from the user via a web iterface. Users find and access blueprints for new software in software galleries.</p>
  <p>Engines is suited to personal and small- to medium-scale organisational use. Individuals can use Engines to host a blog, media library, private instant message service, social networking feed, multiplayer game servers, and an electronic portfolio. Commercial users could run software for an online store, project management, CRM, fleet tracking, voip server, accounting, document sharing, group contacts/calendar and ERP. Schools could host an education platform server, mail and more. There is an almost limitless range of software applications that could be blueprinted to run on Engines.</p>
  <p>Engines is currently in Alpha on a weekly release cycle with a planned Beta Release due in May. The software is released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>
  <p>Some of the advanced features are not functional since Engines is still a work in progress. An AWS AMI can be shared as a demo. There is also a youtube video at</p>
  <p>Currently there are about 25 software applications available in the Engines Software Gallery. These applications have been selected because they cover a range of installation types. There are many more software applications that will be blueprinted in coming months for deplyment on Engines.</p>
