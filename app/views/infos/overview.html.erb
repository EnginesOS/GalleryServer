    Where do I get software to run on Engines? <span class="caret"></span>
  </button>
  <ul class="dropdown-menu dropdown_help">
    <li>Once you install Engines you can use the Installer to access the offical Engines library and third-party libraries.</li>
    <li><%= link_to content_tag(:i, "", class: "fa fa-th-list") + " Library", published_softwares_path, class: "trigger-response-modal" %></li>
    <li>Software libraries contain blueprints, which are the software installation manifests that your Engines system will use to setup your applications.</li>
    <li>Advanced users can sideload applications directly from blueprints, without using software library.</li>
    <li>Users that understand the security implications of giving an application lower-level system access can install applications from Docker images.</li>
    <li>If you are a software developer or advanced user, you'll find it easy to publish your own blueprints and run your own software library.</li>
